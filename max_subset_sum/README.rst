==================
Maximum subset sum
==================
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and finds the sum
of the contiguous sublist within the input list (containing at least one
positive number) which has the largest sum.

Example::

   Input list: [1, -3, 2, 3, 10, -5, 8, -12, 6]
   Expected output: 18


Note:

- The expected output is the sum of this sublist: [2, 3, 10, -5, 8]
- The list can contain both positive and negative numbers, plus zeroes as well.
- The code you produce may use any version of Python
- Please feel free to include your test code (if any)

================
Counting letters
================

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns counts of the vowels
in the string (individually) and of the consonants (altogether).

Example::

   Input string: “This is the string.”
   Expected output:
   e: 1
   i: 3
   consonants: 11

Note:

- There is no need to print out zero counts (like a,o and u in the example).
- The vowel and consonants you need to count are those which belong to the
  English alphabet: 5 vowels + 21 consonants.
  You should make no assumptions about other characters in the string.
- The code you produce must run on python 2.6
- Please feel free to include your test code (if any)

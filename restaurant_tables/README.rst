Restaurant Tables
=================

Our restaurant has round tables. Tables come in different sizes that can
accommodate 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 people. People arrive at our restaurant in
groups of 6 or less. People in the same group want to be seated at the
same table. You can seat a group at any table that has enough empty seats
for them. If it's not possible to accommodate them, they're willing to wait.
Once they're seated, they can stay as long as they want and you cannot ask
them to move to another table (i.e. you cannot move them to make space for
another group).
In terms of fairness of seating order: seat groups in the order they arrive,
but seat opportunistically.
For example: a group of 6 is waiting for a table and there are 4 empty
seats at a table for 6; if a group of 2 arrives you may put them at the
table for 6 but only if you have nowhere else to put them. This may mean
that the group of 6 waits a long time, possibly until they become frustrated
and leave.
